Introduces visitors to the latest local news. The site is developed on wordpress. Database on MySQL. For work, a ready-made template on Bootstrap is used. The complexity of the project is that it is impossible to change any design in the template. Only allowed by the template. I need to make changes, but I don't know how. With the help of DevTools I can change. I don't know how to change it in the template. Haven't found a solution yet. Created over 10 websites. The problem is that all templates use php. I can't work with php yet.
